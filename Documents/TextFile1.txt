Notes:

1. For Web api project (CustomerApp):
---------------------------------------------------------

-> Need to generate access token first, to access webAPIs. allowed emails to generate tokens are
	1. priyanshi21.patel@gmail.com
	2. hardik.trivedi@alterahealth.com
	3. dishant.buch@alterahealth.com

1. using postman generate access token using http://localhost:5231/api/Token/priyanshi21.patel@gmail.com
2. use that access token for use of webAPIs, add this token in authroization part -> type Bearer token and enter token in it.
3. for create user enter http://localhost:5231/api/CreateCustomers and add generated token
4. add proper body portion as ex.
{
  "id": 0,
  "name": "string",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "city": "string"
}
5. to get customers use http://localhost:5231/api/GetCustomers and send it, you will get stored customers
6. if want to get customers by id then use http://localhost:5231/api/GetCustomers/{id} and send it, you will get stored customer
7. to update customer record http://localhost:5231/api/UpdateCustomers/1 add body portion as create method
8. to delete customer record http://localhost:5231/api/DeleteCustomers/1 and send it, it will delete record

[Note: 1. Before sending check Http method in postman
	   2. In swagger we can see all the webAPIs in detail(to check it just run the project CustomerApp)]
